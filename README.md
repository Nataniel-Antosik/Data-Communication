# Data Communication
The entire course on data communication at the West Pomeranian University of Technology in Szczecin.

## General info
Each program generates a signal by modulation, coding, etc. The data is exported to a file with the extension .dat 

## Technologies
All program is created with:
* C++ 
* Visual Studio 2019
* Gnuplot 5.2 patchlevel 8
